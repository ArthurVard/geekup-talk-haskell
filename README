We've been talking about doing a 'Functional Programming Night' at
Liverpool Geekup, perhaps in May 2011.

I'm hoping to do a talk on Haskell, on a "real world" topic.  This code is a
real use-case for one of the large subsystems of my company's product,
http://www.attention-manager.com/ - the quiz engine.

Though the application itself is written in Perl (and isn't likely to be ported
anytime soon) this short example is enough to show some of Haskell's
character, elegance, and applicability to a real-world problem.

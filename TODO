* Get the records from database/persistance layer

* Make the quiz taking pluggable:
    - e.g. might be console like now, or web, or GUI
    - in case of Web, would be asynchronous, 
    how do we manage partial trees?

(ok, much of the TODO is about making it even MORE real-world...
but hey, it's only a proof of concept for the talk slides, so far)

* restructure Quiz type as tree with simpler ADT (tree) and just the special
behaviours as the node/leaves
* e.g. instead of QuizNode being recursive
